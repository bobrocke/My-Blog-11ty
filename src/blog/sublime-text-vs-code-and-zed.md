Developers have plenty of IDEs to choose from, perhaps too many. Sublime Text, VS Code, and Zed are most interesting to me, and I switch back and forth between them. That's not very efficient or productive. What is it that makes me do that?

The easy answer is that they are all very good. But they are good in different ways at different things. So when I find something one is not quite as good at, it makes me switch over to another until I hit something there.

File management (cut, copy, paste, duplicate, rename)

Support

Sublime Text is a text editor, first and foremost. Optional packages are available to add such IDE features as Git support (although the separate Sublime Merge is really meant for that), a terminal, AI, and debugging.

VS Code and Zed are IDEs from the start with all that entails.
