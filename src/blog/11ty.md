I finished moving this blog from WordPress to Hugo and read about a number of other static site generators before I chose Hugo. Hugo is very popular and very capable, but it does have its oddities. Eleventy, or 11ty, is another very popular system and I felt as if I needed to understand it better before absolutely standing with Hugo.

So I'm re-writing my blog with 11ty---no better way to learn about it.
