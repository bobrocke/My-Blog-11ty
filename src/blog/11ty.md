I finished moving this blog from WordPress to Hugo and read about a number of other static site generators before I chose Hugo. Hugo is very popular and very capable, but it does have its oddities. Eleventy, or 11ty, is another very popular system and I felt as if I needed to understand it better before absolutely standing with Hugo.

So I'm re-writing my blog with 11ty---no better way to learn about it.

11ty documentation is hard to find stuff in. I end up doing a web search, but there doesn't seem to be all that much reference material on the web.

While I'm experimenting, I tried out the Bulma CSS library after having used Tailwind with Hugo. My impressions will have to wait for another post, suffice it to say that I'm continuing to work with 11ty using Tailwind.
