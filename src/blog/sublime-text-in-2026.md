I was using Sublime Text back in 2016, or so. After using Atom, VS Code, and most recently Zed, I'm almost back to Sublime Text (now version 4), again.

Is Sublime Text truly a solid option in 2026? Although I think that Zed is the future of native code editors, it's still very early days for Zed. Sublime Text is plenty fast (it's written in C++), has a wealth of packages (even though some are getting pretty old and unmaintained), support on Discord is excellent, and is more customizable than Zed.

With VS Code and Zed being free, Sublime Text cost $99 for a three-year license. After that, you must renew in order to continue getting updates. The good news is that one personal license covers all your computers and operating systems.

You can see a bit of Sublime Text's age in some of its interface. Here you can see it the find and code completion panels.
